(This is a legit read me file according to Alex Dorsey :thonk:)

This repository was written in C++ for the official FRC 2020, by team 4064, the Inzombiacs.
Found in the src\main\cpp folder, there are two main cpp files, one running the main drive train loop,
and the other running the soon to be depreciated ADIS16448 RoboRio IMU. Both files are accompanied by C 
header files for some initializations and declarations. We employ a PixyCam2 for yellow power cell
recogition, and the main PixyCam2 code is written in C under the Pixy2.c file, delcarations in the header 
file. The main file (which is literally just a meme) serves as an auxilliary shell in case we need to 
write anything else, the vast majority of the code is under the DriveTrain.cpp and header files.

Enjoy, happy coding from the InZombiacs.
